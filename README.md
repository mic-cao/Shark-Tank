### Introduction

#### Dataset Description
The dataset comprises 14 seasons of Shark Tank pitches, with predictors such as industry, pitch details, and investor presence. Logistic regression predicts deal success, while linear regression models total deal amounts.

#### Research Questions and Methods
Primary questions focus on predicting deal outcomes and total investment amounts. Models are trained using a train-test split approach to assess accuracy.

### Results

#### Logistic Regression
Models predict deal outcomes for individual sharks. Some models perform well, while others show limited predictive power, suggesting varying investment criteria among sharks.

#### Testing Linear Assumptions
Assumptions of linear regression are tested, revealing predictors with significant relationships to total deal amounts.

#### Linear Regression
A linear regression model predicts total deal amounts, showing strong correlations between predictors and investment values.
